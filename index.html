As a parent at Broadway Elementary School in Region West, I am writing to request your intervention regarding the District's decision to remove Principal Garmon from our school. <strong>Given your direct oversight of Broadway Elementary, your leadership in reversing this misguided decision is crucial.</strong>

<strong>This appears to be a transparent attempt to scapegoat Principal Garmon for systemic failures that predate her leadership.</strong>

Principal Garmon has demonstrated unwavering dedication to Broadway Elementary School throughout her tenure of over 10 years. Her commitment to our students, staff, and families has been evident even during the challenging circumstances of the past two years. She is a responsive, empathetic and tirelessly dedicated leader <strong>who has been forced to manage crises not of her making</strong>.

Perhaps most importantly, Principal Garmon possesses an irreplaceable understanding of Broadway Elementary's unique history and complex needs. She has witnessed firsthand the evolution of our school and the development of our dual language immersion programs. This institutional knowledge cannot be easily transferred to a new administrator who would be starting from scratch.

<strong>As Region West Superintendent, you understand that</strong> the complicated dynamics between our two language immersion programs have existed for over 10 years—long before Principal Garmon's leadership. These are systemic issues that require nuanced leadership and deep understanding of each program's distinct needs and challenges. Principal Garmon has navigated these complexities with skill and has worked diligently to bridge gaps between the programs, despite the constraints placed upon her by the District throughout her tenure following the UCP complaint filed only six weeks into her principalship.

Replacing Principal Garmon with an outsider who lacks this crucial background knowledge and experience with dual language immersion programs will exacerbate, rather than resolve, the underlying issues our school faces—issues she inherited (not created) due to decisions made by LAUSD over the years. The funding disparities, enrollment challenges, and program tensions that currently exist will not simply disappear with a change in leadership—they require thoughtful, informed solutions from someone who truly understands our school's unique context.

<strong>This decision represents a failure to address the real systemic issues.</strong> Instead of confronting the difficult work of addressing systemic inequities and decades of poor planning, this action takes the easy path of removing a dedicated principal who is trying to make the best of an impossible situation created by District policies.

<strong>The real issue is historical District decisions and actions, not her leadership. Removing Principal Garmon would devastate the school, continue the pattern of neglect toward Broadway, and inflame rather than reduce existing tensions.</strong>

I urge you to use your authority as Region West Superintendent to advocate for reconsidering this decision and instead work collaboratively with Principal Garmon to address the systemic issues that face our school. Her expertise, dedication, and institutional knowledge make her the right person to lead Broadway Elementary through these challenges.

<strong>Your voice and advocacy for our school community matters tremendously.</strong>

Sincerely,
