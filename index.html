# Shortened Letter to Superintendent Alberto Carvalho

**Subject: Support for Principal Garmon and Opposition to Her Removal**

Dear **Superintendent Carvalho**:

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the District's decision to remove Principal Garmon from Broadway Elementary School. As a parent at BES, I believe this decision is misguided and will ultimately harm our school and the children. **More troubling, this appears to be a transparent attempt to scapegoat Principal Garmon for the District's own systemic failures.**

Principal Garmon has demonstrated unwavering dedication throughout her 10+ year tenure and possesses irreplaceable understanding of Broadway Elementary's unique dual language immersion programs. **The District seems determined to ignore a fundamental truth**: the complicated dynamics between our programs have existed for over 10 yearsâ€”long before her leadership. She has skillfully navigated these complexities despite District constraints, including following a UCP complaint filed only six weeks into her principalship.

**Replacing Principal Garmon will exacerbate, rather than resolve, the underlying issues** she inherited from LAUSD decisions over the years. **This decision represents a failure of leadership at the District level** and takes the easy path of removing a dedicated principal. **Removing Principal Garmon would devastate the school, continue LAUSD's longstanding pattern of neglect toward Broadway, and inflame existing tensions.**

**The District needs to find a real solution to Broadway's systemic challenges, but removing our principal is not it.** I demand that the District reconsider this decision and instead work collaboratively with Principal Garmon to address the systemic issues that face our school. Her expertise and institutional knowledge make her the right person to lead Broadway Elementary through these challenges.

Sincerely,

**[Your Full Name]**
Parent of Broadway Elementary School Student
