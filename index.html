Dear <strong>Dr. Collier</strong>:

As a parent at Broadway Elementary School in Region West, I am writing to request your intervention regarding the District's decision to remove Principal Garmon from our school. <strong>Given your direct oversight of Broadway Elementary, your leadership in reversing this misguided decision is crucial. This appears to be a transparent attempt to scapegoat Principal Garmon for systemic failures that predate her leadership.</strong>

Principal Garmon has demonstrated unwavering dedication throughout her 10+ year tenure and possesses irreplaceable understanding of our dual language immersion programs. <strong>As Region West Superintendent, you know</strong> the complicated dynamics between our programs existed long before her leadership---she has skillfully navigated these complexities despite District constraints.

<strong>Replacing Principal Garmon will exacerbate, rather than resolve, the underlying issues</strong> she inherited from years of LAUSD decisions. <strong>This decision represents a failure to address the real systemic issues</strong> and takes the easy path of removing a dedicated principal. <strong>Removing Principal Garmon would devastate the school and inflame existing tensions.</strong>

<strong>The District needs to find a real solution to Broadway's systemic challenges, but removing our experienced principal is not it.</strong> I urge you to use your authority as Region West Superintendent to advocate for reconsidering this decision and instead work collaboratively with Principal Garmon to address the systemic issues that face our school. <strong>Your voice and advocacy for our school community matters tremendously.</strong>

Sincerely,
